title: "Likelihood and Model Quality"
---

## What problem does likelihood solve?

Likelihood measures how well a model with fixed parameters explains
the observed data.

## Why is it a product over data points?

Because we assume data points are independent.
This means the joint probability factors into a product.

## Why does this relate to loss functions?

Taking the negative log-likelihood converts likelihood into a loss
that can be minimized during training.
